- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProneRainbow (Mark), a junior full stack developer in the South of England. 
- My job mainly has me using .Net and React to build web-apps, but I way prefer it when I get to let loose a little and add a bit of pazzazz to a site.
- I've decided to start documenting more of learning on GitHub, so sorry if you take a look and a lot of this is pretty basic and boring!

- 👀 I’m interested in animating the web, I love using CSS and JavaScript to make cool animations and effects.
- I don't get much time to sudy it, but UX and UI design and the psycology that goes behind them I find fascinating. And what's the point of a website nobody wants 
to use right?! 
- I also like a cool ale on a summers day ;)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Three.JS and GSAP and furthering my React and JS skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything web based, that is either artistic or flashy, or both!

- 📫 If you're looking for a study budy, want to geek out, or would like to collab, drop me a message on Discord: ProneRainbow#6085 or email me at pronerainbow@protonmail.com / markpowell87@protonmail.com
